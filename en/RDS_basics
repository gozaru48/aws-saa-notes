# Amazon RDS Basics

## What is RDS?
- RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service for relational databases
- Supports: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Amazon Aurora

## Key Features
- Automated backups and snapshots
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Read replicas for horizontal read scaling (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)

## Storage Options
- General Purpose (gp2 / gp3)
- Provisioned IOPS (io1)
- Magnetic (deprecated)

## Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit (KMS, SSL)
- IAM authentication
- VPC-based access control (SG, subnet)

## Common Pitfalls
- Single-AZ = no HA (use Multi-AZ for production)
- Read replicas are for **reads only**, not automatic failover
- Storage type can't be downgraded (e.g., io1 â†’ gp2)
