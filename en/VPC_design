# VPC Design Basics

## Core Components
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): logically isolated section of AWS network.
- Subnet: public (with IGW) or private (via NAT or no internet access).
- Route Table: defines outbound traffic behavior for each subnet.

## High Availability
- Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
- Use NAT Gateway in public subnet for private subnet internet access

## Common Pitfalls
- Route Table misconfiguration blocks access
- IGW not attached â†’ public subnet is ineffective
- Security Group vs NACL: stateful vs stateless filtering
