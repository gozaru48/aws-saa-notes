# IAM Role vs IAM Policy

## IAM Policy
- Defines *what actions are allowed* on which resources
- Attached to IAM Users, Groups, or Roles

## IAM Role
- Assume role concept (sts:AssumeRole)
- Used by services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) or external identities (SAML, OIDC)

## Differences
- Policy = permission rules
- Role = identity with temporary credentials and permissions

## Example Use Cases
- EC2 assumes IAM Role to access S3 securely
- Cross-account access via IAM Role trust policy
