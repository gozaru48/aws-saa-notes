# CloudWatch and CloudTrail - Differences and Use Cases

## Amazon CloudWatch
- Monitoring service for logs, metrics, and alarms
- Use cases:
  - Set alarms for EC2 CPU usage
  - Visualize Lambda invocation count
  - Centralize logs using CloudWatch Logs

### Key Features
- Metrics (default or custom)
- Logs (via agent or SDK)
- Alarms (triggered by thresholds)
- Dashboards

## AWS CloudTrail
- Auditing and governance tool
- Records API calls across AWS services
- Delivered as JSON logs to S3

### Key Features
- Tracks "who did what, when, and from where"
- Integrates with EventBridge and CloudWatch
- Supports multi-region trails

## Comparison Table

| Feature         | CloudWatch               | CloudTrail                    |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Purpose         | Monitoring and Alerting   | Auditing and Compliance       |
| Data Type       | Metrics / Logs            | API Activity Logs             |
| Delivery        | Near real-time            | Delivered to S3 (5 min–15 min delay) |
| Typical Use     | CPU usage, errors         | IAM user actions, API usage   |

## Common Pitfalls
- CloudWatch ≠ Logging of user actions
- CloudTrail logs are not immediate (check delay)
- S3 bucket for CloudTrail must be properly secured
